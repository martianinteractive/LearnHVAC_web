What is WebORB for Rails:
-------------------------
WebORB for Rails is server-side technology enabling connectivity 
between Flex and Flash Remoting clients and Ruby on Rails applications.
WebORB for Rails can be installed as a plugin into any Rails 
application to expose Ruby classes as remote services. The product 
provides a complete implementation of the Adobe's AMF0 and AMF3 
messaging protocols and thus supports any Flash Remoting or Flex 
client.
