=== Savage Beast ===

Savage Beast is a Rails Message forum plugin based on the popular Beast plugin.
The Savage Beast plugin has been installed in hundreds of Rails sites, partially
because it's the only viable choice for a message forum plugin, but also because
it incorporates a lot of features that would be a time-consuming headache for you
to implement yourself.

This version of Savage Beast has been tested working in Rails 2.3 without
the Engines plugin, and in Rails 2.0-2.2 with use of the Engines plugin.

See http://www.williambharding.com/blog/rails/savage-beast-23-a-rails-22-23-message-forum-plugin/ for install instructions

Please post any comments or suggestions to the blog post.  If you would like

=== On Rails 2.2 and Earlier ===
If you're rolling Rails 2.2 or earlier, be sure you carefully follow the
Engines installation instructions!  That
line to add to your environment file is easily missed.

=== On Rails 2.0 ===
If you're running Rails 2.0, you're probably better off using the version
at http://code.google.com/p/savage-beast-2/, which was specifically tested with
Rails 2.0.
